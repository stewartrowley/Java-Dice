# Overview

Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.

This software is a demonstration of what I have learned in Java. There are examples of varibles, loops, functions, classes, data, conditionals and expressions. It is basic examples of theses. In the program I used ArrayList. The software is a simple game where what you roll gives you points. Certain numbers gives you points. Such as the 1 or 6 does.

Describe your purpose for writing this software.

The purpose of this software was to learn the basic princples of Java. To understand what Java is. To take some program and learn what the Java language is like. It is very basic program and could have some more work done on it but I felt like I got what I needed to know about it.

Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.

# Future Work

Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.
* Item 1 - Could fix having the game without you making it end. Meaning if you don't roll a certain number then, the game ends.
* Item 2 - Could have it display game over and score total.
* Item 3 - I could put the classes in different files.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
